# Goldilocks
## Introduction
Goldilocks is a very basic web crawler built entirely with JavaScript. When it was first created it was entirely terminal-based, but with the author's increasing interest in front-end technologies, it was made entirely browser-based.

## Requirements and Dependencies
* MongoDB Server must be installed and setup on the host machine to use the web crawler

## Installation
`git clone https://github.com/darius-daniel/Goldilocks.git`

`cd Goldilocks`

`npm install`

`npm run build`

`npm run start`

Then type `localhost:3000` in your web browser of choice and hit enter. Voila!
